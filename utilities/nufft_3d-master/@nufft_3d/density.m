% this "density" is very sensitive to oversampling factor
% e.g. u=1 acts like a highpass filter and u=4 a lowpass.
% this is probably correct behaviour... the "density" of
% samples is calculated on the fine grid, so for fixed J
% the density flattens off (i.e. spokes stop interacting)
% as we move away from the center of k-space. this makes
% it challenging to interpret d as "the" sample density.
% following Sedarat we will interpret d as a diagonal
% approximation to the full least squares problem. in a
% sane world, gridding and least squares should give the
% same ballpark answer.
%
%      Qx = k [for DFT matrix Q]
%       x = Q'*D*k [gridding D=diag(d)]
% Q'*D*Qx = Q'*D*k [least squares weighted by D^0.5]
%
% since it's plain rude for the two recons to give very
% different answers, the modest goal is to scale d such
% that diag(Q'*D*D) is 1.
%
% we can get the k-th diagonal of (Q'*D*Q) by letting e =
% [0...0 1 0...0]' (1 at the k-th position) then computing
% v = Q'*D*Q*e using our current D. the k-th element of v
% is k-th diagonal element (Q'*D*Q). E.g. if k=2 then
%
% v = [a1 a2 a3] [0] = [a2]
%     [a4 a5 a6] [1]   [a5] <---the k-th element
%     [a7 a8 a9] [0]   [a8]
%
% in Cartesian the diagonal of (Q'*D*Q) is the mean of the
% sample weighting squared (typically an average of 1s and
% 0s for present/absent). using that same idea we can get
% diag(Q'*D*Q) quickly from the center of aNUFT(d) aka the
% mean of FFT(aNUFT(d)).

% diagonal of Q'*D*Q with current d
q = obj.aNUFT(d);
if obj.N(3)==1
    dwsd = real(q(obj.N(1)/2+1,obj.N(2)/2+1));
else
    dwsd = real(q(obj.N(1)/2+1,obj.N(2)/2+1,obj.N(3)/2+1));
end

% the dwsd is hard to interpret other than diag(Q'*D*Q) but
% we can normalize for weighting to get the mean sampling
% density which is the diagonal of Q'*Q. an expensive way
% of calculating no. data points / no. matrix points!
sd = dwsd / mean(d);

% measure true diagonals of Q'*Q and Q'*D*Q (V. SLOW)

% remains a "mystery" factor of u so let's just remove that for now
